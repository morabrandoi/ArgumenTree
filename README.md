## Overview
### Description
Regular app comment sections like twitter or youtube comments are not structured properly to have productive coversations. A dedicated platform where the conversation is more naturally structured to how conversations play out (a tree like structure).

### App Evaluation
- **Category:**
Social Media / Forum / Political
- **Mobile:**
Reddit-Like UI at least for the homepage. Would be able to browse through infinte list of topics with ability to sort bt category.
    - What makes your app more than a glorified website?
        - Will be easy to pick up and put down by loading directly into the listView screen and offer infinite scrolling. There will be the ability to share comments to other apps like facebook. It can also send push notifications and integrate with camera for associated media with posts.
- **Story:**
    - How clear is the value of this app to your audience?
        - Arguing/Debating online can be frustrating since the structure of comments on other websites is too linear to have meaningful conversations. There would also be a strong emphasis on sources as well as easy integration for allowing them.
    - How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?
        - They seemed to like the idea since it would at the very least be a big change in pace from the norm of linear conversations online.
- **Market:**
    - What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
        - Possibly the majority of people that use any form of social media since arguing and debating one's opinions is a primary way users engage.
    - Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
        - I believe it does since those who share their opinions online in apps like Instagram or Tik Tok aren't even able to post clickable links.
    - Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
        - Even a small percentage of people who frequently use comment sections to debate / argue would make a large audience for this application so I believe there is an audience for this kind of app.
- **Habit:**
    - How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
        - I foresee a significant portion of the traffic from this app coming from links in other parts of the internet that link to specific topics someone may be discussing. So about 1/2 as often as people go on other social media apps. A user might open this app 5 times a week if they frequent the internet comment sections.
    - Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?
        - I would think the average user creates 25% of the time and just watches 75% of the time since this app would most likely be used to settle debates or make points in a conversation happening elsewhere.
- **Scope:**
    - How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?
        - The biggest technical challenge would be to display the tree structure of the argument. Other than that, it would be a lot of moving between screens with intents.
    - Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?
        - Yes I believe it would be. The core functionality is quite simple and reddit-like (with the twist of a tree structure for conversation) and a large emphasis on sources.
    - How clearly defined is the product you want to build?
        - Well defined.
